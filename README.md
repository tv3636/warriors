# Forgotten Runes Warriors Guild Data & Stats

Python script and associated csv and json data from [Forgotten Runes Warriors Guild](https://www.forgottenrunes.com/warriors)

`names.py` generates two json files:

- `warriors.json` which just maps each token ID to its name
- `stats.json` which counts the occurence of each name component, and displays in sorted order


`warriors.csv` is included with the repo and will be updated as more warriors are revealed.
